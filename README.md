# 🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to understand casualty patterns based on **severity levels** and **vehicle types**. The main objective is to extract meaningful insights from accident statistics and present them in a clear, data-driven manner.

The analysis is performed using **summarized road accident data** extracted from an Excel dataset and visualized through a data analysis dashboard.
The **dashboard** contains all analysis steps and visualizations used to explore the dataset and present insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze accident severity distribution
- Understand vehicle-wise casualty patterns
- Present insights using a clear analytical dashboard
- Demonstrate data analysis skills for academic and portfolio purposes
---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **aggregated road accident information**, including:

- Total number of casualties
- Casualty severity levels:
  - Fatal
  - Serious
  - Slight
- Vehicle-wise casualty distribution:
  - Cars
  - Bikes
  - Vans
  - Buses
  - Agricultural vehicles
  - Other vehicles

The data is organized in a **pivot-table–style format**, which allows quick statistical analysis and visualization.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🚑 Casualty Severity Distribution
- **Total Casualties:** 417,883  
- **Fatal:** 7,135 (~1.7%)  
- **Serious:** 59,312 (~14.2%)  
- **Slight:** 351,436 (~84.1%)

Most road accidents resulted in **slight injuries**, while fatal cases represent a relatively small proportion of total casualties.

### 🚗 Vehicle-wise Casualties
- **Cars:** 333,485 (~79.8%)
- **Bikes:** 33,672
- **Vans:** 33,472
- **Buses:** 12,798
- **Agricultural Vehicles:** 1,032
- **Other Vehicles:** 3,424

Car-related accidents contribute the **largest share of total casualties** compared to other vehicle types.
